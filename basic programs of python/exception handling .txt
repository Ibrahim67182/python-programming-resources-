exception handling 


try:

lines of code which you want to detect for errors 


except Exception as e:

print(e)




if you dont want to print error then just use 

try:

////code
except:
print("invalid code")


or you can handle multiple errors at the same time 


try:


except ValueError:

except IndexError:
