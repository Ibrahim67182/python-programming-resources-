sets

order not matter
all datatypes store in single set

make using curly braces { }

dictonaries


these are ordered

 
if you want to check whether key exists and throw error by program 
then use the syntax


e.g
info = {"name":"ibrahim", "age":"20", "grade":"A"}

print(info["name2"])

this will give error if key doesnt exist


otherwise 

print(info.get("name2"))  this will print none not give error
