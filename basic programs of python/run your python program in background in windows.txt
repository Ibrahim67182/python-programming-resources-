Method 1: Run the Script as a Background Process Using pythonw.exe

Save your script with a .py extension (e.g., your_script.py).

Run the Script Using pythonw.exe:
Use pythonw.exe to run your script in the background.

Open Run by pressing Win + R.
Type the following command and press Enter:

pythonw.exe C:\Path\To\your_script.py
